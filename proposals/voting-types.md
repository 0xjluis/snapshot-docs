# Voting systems

{% hint style="info" %}
Snapshot supports a number of different voting types and we plan to support many more in the future. If you would like to request a new voting type, please open a feature request here [https://features.snapshot.org/feature-requests](https://features.snapshot.org/feature-requests)
{% endhint %}

Voting systems represent the method used to calculate the results of a vote on the basis of the voting power. While voting strategies calculate voting power, voting systems calculate the results of votes.

Depending on your proposal, different voting systems also allow users to:&#x20;

Choose one option only (single choice voting) spread their votes over multiple options (weighted voting) weigh the results based on individual addresses as well as voting power (quadratic voting) approve a certain number of options (approval voting) rank the different choices in their order of preference (ranked-choice voting) be able to abstain from voting while still participating in quorum (basic voting)

Let's look more in depth at each voting type:

### Single choice voting

Each voter selects only one choice. The results will reflect these votes in terms of percentages. Ideal to choose one option from many.

Example: Your community needs to choose&#x20;

### Approval voting

Each voter may select ("approve") any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power.

Example? - TBD

### Quadratic voting

Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices. The results are calculated quadratically, you can test out these calculations here [https://wtfisqf.com/](https://wtfisqf.com)

Example? - TBD

### Ranked choice voting (IRV)

Each voter may rank any number of choices. Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an "instant runoff" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.

Example? - TBD

### Weighted voting

Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices. This voting method was first introduced by Float Protocol with [https://scattershot.page](https://scattershot.page) (a fork of Snapshot).

Example? - TBD
