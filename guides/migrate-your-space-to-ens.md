# Migrate your space to ENS

### 1. Create a space with ENS

To migrate your space you will need first to create the space with ENS.   
  
You can use this url to get your previous space settings populated in the form: https://snapshot.page/\#/**&lt;ens\_space\_id&gt;**/settings/**&lt;previous\_space\_id&gt;**  
Example: https://snapshot.page/\#/**yam.eth**/settings/**yam**

{% page-ref page="create-a-space.md" %}

### 2. Migrate proposals, votes and urls

The migration of the proposals, votes and urls is done manually, once your space with ENS is ready please contact an admin on [Discord](https://discord.snapshot.page) to do the changes.
