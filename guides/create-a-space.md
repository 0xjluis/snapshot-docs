# Create a space with ENS \(beta\)

#### 1. Get an ENS domain for your space

If you don't have an ENS domain yet for your space you can register one here: [https://app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains/)

#### 2. Link your ENS domain to Snapshot with "contenthash"

* Go on this url: https://snapshot.page/\#/name.eth/settings \(change `name.eth` to your ENS domain\).
* Copy the IPNS link in the ENS field.
* Click on "Set record on ENS", you will get redirected to your ENS domain.
* Click on "ADD/EDIT RECORD" on ENS app.
* Paste the IPNS link in the "CONTENT" field.
* Click confirm and submit the change.

**3. Setup your space settings**

* Go again on this url: https://snapshot.page/\#/name.eth/settings. If the "contenthash" was set correctly on ENS you should have a button "See on ENS" instead of "Set record on ENS".
* Edit your space settings
* Click "Save" and sign settings message on your wallet.
* Now you are set! You can go on https://snapshot.page/\#/name.eth to see your space.

#### Good to know

* When you create or edit a space, it take around 2min to see the changes live.
