### **2: Copy the space example folder**

{% embed url="https://github.com/balancer-labs/snapshot/tree/develop/spaces/example" %}

### **3: Change your space metadata and logo**

* The name of the folder must be the key of your space. 
* You must add both `logo.png` and `space.png` images for your space with a size of 256 x 256 pixels.
* If you want the default skin you can delete the file `skin.scss`.

### **4: Create a skin \(optional\)**

* If you want a skin you can change colors in the file `skin.scss` and change the `.name` to the id of your space.

### **5: Make a pull request**  **6: Test it!**

* Open the Fleek test deployment in the PR

* Create a test proposal for your space and vote for it. ****
* If the token logo isn't working it's normal, it will work when PR merged.
