You have a good understanding on how Snapshot works and want to help others? Get this role and try to answer questions from others or create a GitHub issue when someone find a bug. _Rewards: 1,000 USDC / month_

### Get started

* When someone ask a question on Discord or Telegram, if you know the answer, feel free to answer. If you don't know the answer you can:
  * Search on Discord or Telegram if the question was asked already. 
  * Try to figure out yourself with Snapshot documentation.
* When someone report an issue, the first thing you can do is to try by yourself. If you can reproduce the issue and it's something that is obviously not working you can create an issue on GitHub here: [https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
