# Sub-Spaces

Organizations have the option to create additional spaces and link between them. On the settings page you can define "Sub-spaces". Enter either a main space or multiple sub-spaces.

Do this for both, your main space and all sub-spaces you want to link to (and from). Only when both sides match, links will be displayed in the sidebar of your spaces.
