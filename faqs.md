# FAQs

**1: Is Snapshot completely off-chain? or is it possible to use it for on-chain too?**

The main idea of Snapshot is to let users vote and post new proposals without the need of paying fees while keeping the idea of decentralization intact! We offer off-chain functionality fully decentralized and are working on an on-chain option as well!
