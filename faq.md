Usually snapshot checks and follows through PRs every 24 to 48h, if you submitted yours and snapshot did not get back to you within this time limit, please chat with us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/dDbNGZe) or [**Telegram**](https://t.me/snapshotlabs)**.**

## **2: I am getting an error "wrong timestamp", what is the problem?**

Your computer time is not synced, follow the steps to fix it: \(for other errors check [here](guides/error-messages.md)\)

1. Make sure your time zone is a correct timezone, set it from the dropdown box.
