# F.A.Q.

**1: I pushed my PR, when do you check it? and what time it will be live?**

Usually snapshot checks and follows through PRs every 24 to 48h, if you submitted yours and snapshot did not get back to you within this time limit, please chat with us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/dDbNGZe) or [**Telegram**](https://t.me/snapshotlabs)**.**

\*\*\*\*

**2: I am getting an error "wrong timestamp", what is the problem?**

Make sure your computer clock is synced, to do so: go to your date and time settings and tick the "Sync automaticaly" checkbox/option from there. \(other errors? check [here](guides/error-messages.md)\)



**3: I went to** `https://snapshot.page/#/your-space` **but i see a blank page, how to fix it?**

* Make sure your PR is already merged.
* Make sure you are connected with metamask on the ETH mainnet.
* Check if you are using a browser other than Chrome.
