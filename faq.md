# F.A.Q.

## **1: I pushed my PR, when do you check it? and what time it will be live?**

Usually snapshot checks and follows through PRs every 24 to 48h, if you submitted yours and snapshot did not get back to you within this time limit, please chat with us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/dDbNGZe) or [**Telegram**](https://t.me/snapshotlabs)**.**

## **2: I am getting an error "wrong timestamp", what is the problem?**

Most likely the issue is that your computer time is not synchronized with the internet time. This is how to fix this:

#### On MacOS

1. On your Mac, choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, then click Date & Time. 
2. Click Date & Time, then set the date and time automatically.

#### On Windows

1. Go to Start  &gt; Settings  &gt; Time & language &gt; Date & time.
2. Then set time automatically.

## **3: I went to** `https://snapshot.page/#/your-space` **but i see a blank page, how to fix it?**

* Make sure your PR is already merged.
* Make sure you are connected with metamask on the ETH mainnet.
* Check if you are using a browser other than Chrome. 

## **4: How can i get my space showing on the Snapshot homepage?**

1. Make sure u follow all here [https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-space](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-space)
2. Add key here [https://github.com/bonustrack/snapshot-spaces/blob/master/spaces/homepage.json](https://github.com/bonustrack/snapshot-spaces/blob/master/spaces/homepage.json)
3. Your space must have activity on it, so we include it, otherwise empty space or space with low / no participation behavior, doenst get added.

## **5: How can i access my space or the demo space on snapshot?**

Change **YOUR-KEY** on the links:

* If you want to access snapshot live: [http://snapshot.page/\#/**YOUR-KEY**](http://snapshot.page/#/YOUR-KEY) \(only works after live deploy\)
* If you want to access snapshot demo: [http://demo.snapshot.page/\#/**YOUR-KEY**](http://demo.snapshot.page/#/YOUR-KEY)\*\*\*\*
